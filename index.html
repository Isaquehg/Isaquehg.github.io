            <h1>Who Am I</h1>
            <p class="bio">
            I am an enthusiastic developer and Christian based in Brazil.
            My goal is to develop better technologies while traveling around the world and capturing moments through photography.
            My mission is to carry the Message of Jesus about Hope and Salvation to the world!</p>
            <p class="bio">
            My journey began in 2002, growing up in a small town surrounded by my family. This humble environment sparked the flames of innovation within me from a young age. In such places, we didn't have access to specialists or experts, so we had to rely on our own criativity to overcome challenges and fix things. This instilled in me a deep curiosity about how the world works and the drive to find creative solutions to problems.</p>
            <p class="bio">Years later, I embarked on an exciting educational path, enrolling in university to pursue a degree in Software Engineering. This invaluable opportunity allowed me to refine my skills and gain hands-on experience working with cutting-edge technology. At Inatel, I had the privilege of learning from a vast network of experts, enriching my understanding and expertise.</p>
            <p class="bio">However, my journey is not solely defined by technical pursuits. Above all, I am driven by a higher purpose: to share the life-changing message of Jesus Christ. None of my achievements and growth would be possible without His guidance and grace. I am deeply grateful for His presence in my life, and I extend my heartfelt thanks to my family and friends, whose unwavering support has been a source of strength throughout this transformative path.</p>

                <p>My first work experience started with in father's commerce. Working together, I could learn a lot! There are things we can't simply learn, but got to live it! It was that case. Starting from the factory floor until behind the scenes, I learned how things work.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="xp2" class="xp">
                <h2 class="number">02</h2>
                <p>My second stop point was the CREA Jr, in the Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações (Inatel). CREA is like an engineering regulatory body in Brazil. The CREA Jr. was a fully student-run company, responsible to representate the official body in the Inatel. I worked a lot with documents and dealed with some sheets. It was a good entry point to my university activities.</p>

                <h2 class="number">03</h2>
                <p>At Inatel, now inside the Cybersecurity and Internet of Things laboratory(CS&I Lab), I worked in Deep Learning applied to Software Defined Radio, to create a model that reduces the signal's noise. It was my first experience in scientific research, so I could learn more how academic reasearch works and apply my Python, Numpy and TensorFlow skills.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="xp4" class="xp">
                <h2 class="number">04</h2>
                <p>After this experience with Deep Learning, I moved to the Cybersecurity field. This was challenging! I've never worked with security before. I started working in DTLS implementation in a NodeMCU. There, I could experiment international collaboration working with a french student, which helped me developening not only technical skills, but also intercultural ones.</p>

                <h2 class="number">05</h2>
                <p>Now, July, 23; I'm wonking in the Mobile Device Vulnerability Analysis research. In this field I could get a better sight about the "behind the scenes" of mobile apps. Understanding and mitigating attacks that are exponentially increasing in devices that are a tools for the modern society. Here, studies and applications about OWASP, NIST and other similar organizatinos guided us into the security implementation standards.</p>

            <div id="jesusChrist" class="gospel">
                <h2>Jesus Christ</h2>
                <p>It's impossible not talking about Jesus when telling about my trajectory.
                    If I hadn't know Jesus, all my life would be void!
                    We cannot live only to study and work. The humans are not machines, we gotta have a major purpose, a passion! So, in the following lines, I'd like to invite you to reflect with me about the reason of what we're doing.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="lifeMeaning" class="gospel">
                <h2>Life Meaning</h2>
                <p>We will always have a void inside ourselves, even if we have money, power and all that we want. Solomon was a Israeli king who had everything he would want. After he enjoyed all the pleasures the world could give, he said in his book, Ecclesiastes, 2:10-11: 
                    "10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. 
                    My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil.
                    11 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun."</p>
            </div>

            <div id="andU" class="gospel">
                <h2>And You?</h2>
                <p>Have you ever wondered about this? I would like you think about the purpose of your work and life. And if you feel without purpose, I invite you to follow Jesus Christ. Only Jesus can give us the direction and is able to save. In Matthew 16:26 says: "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?".</p>
            </div>

            <div id="theMessage" class="gospel">
                <h2>The Message</h2>
                <p>Jesus has an amazing history and plan for you! Unfortunaly, we, humans, are sinners, so we were far from God. But Jesus gives us the opportunity to repent of our sins and follow Him! This is the Gospel! We have the chance, so let's catch this opportunity. The message is simple, We just need to accept it!!</p>
