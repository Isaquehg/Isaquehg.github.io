            <h1>Who Am I</h1>
            <p class="bio">First, let me introduce myself.
            My journey began in 2002 when I was born and raised with my family in a small town. This environment ignited the fire of innovation within me! In places like that, we don't have specialists or people who are specialized in things, so if something breaks or stops working, we have to figure it out ourselves.</p>
            <p class="bio">After several years, I enrolled in university, majoring in Software Engineering. This opportunity allowed me to enhance my skills and gain hands-on experience working with technology. At Inatel, I learned from others through the vast network of experts that the institute offered.</p>
            <p class="bio">And, of course, I can't forget to mention that I'm here for a purpose: to share the good news of Jesus Christ. None of this would have been possible without Him, and I'm grateful for His guidance in my journey thus far. I also extend my thanks to my family and friends who have supported me immensely throughout this path.</p>
            <p class="bio">Alright, I've spoken quite a bit. So, who am I?
            I am an enthusiastic developer and Christian based in Brazil.
            My goal is to develop better technologies while traveling around the world and capturing moments through photography.
            My mission is to bring hope and salvation to the world through Jesus' Message!</p>

                <p>My first work experience started with in father's commerce. Working together, I could learn a lot! There are things we can't simply learn, but got to live it! It was that case. Starting from the factory floor until behind the scenes, I learned how things work.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="xp2" class="xp">
                <h2 class="number">02</h2>
                <p>My second stop point was the CREA Jr, in the Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações (Inatel). CREA is like an engineering regulatory body in Brazil. The CREA Jr. was a fully student-run company, responsible to representate the official body in the Inatel. I worked a lot with documents and dealed with some sheets. It was a good entry point to my university activities.</p>

            <div id="xp3" class="xp">
                <h2 class="number">03</h2>
                <p>At Inatel, now inside the Cybersecurity and Internet of Things laboratory(CS&I Lab), I worked in Deep Learning applied to Software Defined Radio, to create a model that reduces the signal's noise. It was my first experience in scientific research, so I could learn more how academic reasearch works and apply my Python, Numpy and TensorFlow skills.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="xp4" class="xp">
                <h2 class="number">04</h2>
                <p>After this experience with Deep Learning, I moved to the Cybersecurity field. This was challenging! I've never worked with security before. I started working in DTLS implementation in a NodeMCU. There, I could experiment international collaboration working with a french student, which helped me developening not only technical skills, but also intercultural ones.</p>

            <div id="xp5" class="xp">
                <h2 class="number">05</h2>
                <p>Now, July, 23; I'm wonking in the Mobile Device Vulnerability Analysis research. In this field I could get a better sight about the "behind the scenes" of mobile apps. Understanding and mitigating attacks that are exponentially increasing in devices that are a tools for the modern society. Here, studies and applications about OWASP, NIST and other similar organizatinos guided us into the security implementation standards.</p>

            <div id="jesusChrist" class="gospel">
                <h2>Jesus Christ</h2>
                <p>It's impossible not talking about Jesus when telling about my trajectory.
                    If I hadn't know Jesus, all my life would be void!
                    We cannot live only to study and work. The humans are not machines, we gotta have a major purpose, a passion! So, in the following lines, I'd like to invite you to reflect with me about the reason of what we're doing.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="lifeMeaning" class="gospel">
                <h2>Life Meaning</h2>
                <p>We will always have a void inside ourselves, even if we have money, power and all that we want. Solomon was a Israeli king who had everything he would want. After he enjoyed all the pleasures the world could give, he said in his book, Ecclesiastes, 2:10-11: 
                    "10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. 
                    My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil.
                    11 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun."</p>
            </div>

            <div id="andU" class="gospel">
                <h2>And You?</h2>
                <p>Have you ever wondered about this? I would like you think about the purpose of your work and life. And if you feel without purpose, I invite you to follow Jesus Christ ;) Only Jesus can give us the direction and is able to save. In Matthew 16:26 says: "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?".</p>
            </div>

            <div id="theMessage" class="gospel">
                <h2>The Message</h2>
                <p>Jesus has an amazing history and plan for you! Unfortunaly, we, humans, are sinners, so we were far from God. But Jesus gives us the opportunity to repent of our sins and follow Him! This is the Gospel! We have the chance, so let's catch this opportunity. The message is simple, We just need to accept it!!</p>
